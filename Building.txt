Before you can build and run, you must first set a few environment variables based on your OpenCV installation location (and apriltag build, if using Windows):
1. Named OPENCV_JAR which is the absolute path to the opencv-460.jar file.
(2. Named OPENCV_CMAKE_DIR which is the absolute path of the directory containing the opencv cmake files.)
(3. Named APRILTAG_DEBUG_CMAKE_DIR which is the absolute path of the directory containing the debug apriltag cmake files (built/installed from apriltag repository).)
(4. Named APRILTAG_CMAKE_DIR which is the absolute path of the directory containing the retail apriltag cmake files (built/installed from apriltag repository).)

For me, this is:
Windows:	C:\opencv\build\java\opencv-460.jar, C:\opencv\build\x64\vc15\lib, C:\Users\wm_ra\git\apriltag\out\install\x64-Debug\share\apriltag\cmake, and C:\Users\wm_ra\git\apriltag\out\install\x64-Release\share\apriltag\cmake
RPI:		/usr/local/share/java/opencv4/opencv-460.jar

On Windows you can set the environment variable using Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables.
On Linux, add the key-value pair (KEY=VALUE) to /etc/environment.  You can also run "export OPENCV_JAR=..." for temporary variables.
After adding environment variables, you need to reboot.
